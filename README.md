# µPBT
## The Free, Easy-To-Use Unreal Engine Plugin Build Tool By HowToCompute.

### What Is µPBT?
µPBT (also known as uPBT) is an easy-to-use utility that allows you to build unreal engine plugins easily. Don't worry about dealing with the (stupid) windows command line, having to copy and paste all kinds of file paths or any of that stuff. Just select the version of UE4 you want to use, and drag your plugin to generate a build!

### How Do I Obtain µPBT?
µPBT can easily be obtained by heading to the releases tab and downloading the latest release. Binaries are currently only available for Windows. Please note that µPBT is currently still in Beta, and you may hit issues. Also note that we are not responsible for any kind of loss that may result from using µPBT.

### What Are The Future Development Plans For µPBT?
We don't currently have any major plans ahead. We're going to work on making µPBT more stable, and adding more platforms, but don't currently have any plans beyond that.
